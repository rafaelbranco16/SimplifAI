# SimplifAI

## üëã Introduction
In the healthcare sector, existing bureaucracy negatively impacts the time dedicated to clinical activities and harms the doctor-patient relationship. With this project, we aim to simplify some bureaucratic processes performed by doctors, such as (i) the creation of discharge notes from hospitalizations and (ii) the writing of clinical consultation diaries. We intend to use techniques for summarization and anonymization of text, speech-to-text, and topic analysis, among others, related to technologies associated with LLMs.

This project is a proof of concept (PoC) that aims to address the issues explained above. It is understood that this goes against the rules of the AI Act, but as a PoC, it should demonstrate that it is possible and that AI has the capability to effectively assist doctors in making their work easier.

## üè• Motivation and Background

## üéØ Project Scope and Goals
Our project targets two primary bureaucratic processes:
1. The creation of discharge notes from hospitalizations.
2. The writing of clinical consultation diaries.

We use various advanced techniques such as text summarization, anonymization, speech-to-text, and topic analysis to achieve these goals.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Proof of Concept (PoC)

This project is a proof of concept (PoC) that demonstrates the feasibility of using AI to assist in healthcare documentation. It is understood that this PoC might contravene the rules of the AI Act, but it aims to show that AI has the potential to significantly ease the workload of doctors.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges and Considerations

### Ethical and Legal Considerations
- Addressing potential conflicts with the AI Act and ensuring ethical use of AI in healthcare.

### Technical Challenges
- Accurate voice capture and transcription.
- Ensuring robust anonymization of sensitive data.~

## üåü Conclusion and Impact 

This proof of concept demonstrates the potential of AI to alleviate the bureaucratic burden on doctors, thereby enhancing their efficiency and improving the doctor-patient relationship. By automating routine documentation tasks, we can significantly impact the healthcare sector, allowing doctors to focus more on patient care.
